## Customization 🛠️

You can personalize the app by modifying the styles and layout in the **CSS** file.

### 1⃣ **Theme Colors**
   - The app’s color theme is controlled by CSS variables. You can change these to match your brand or favorite colors.
   - To change the theme color, simply modify the `--theme-color` variable in the `:root` section:
     ```css
     :root {
         --theme-color: #3498db;  /* Set your preferred color */
         --theme-color-dark: #2980b9; /* Darker shade for hover effects */
     }
     ```

### 2⃣ **Button Customization**
   - Change the appearance of the buttons like "Add Todo" or "Delete" by modifying their respective CSS properties:
     ```css
     #add-todo-btn {
         background-color: #3498db;
         border-radius: 25px;
         color: white;
     }
     ```

### 3⃣ **Responsive Layout Adjustments**
   - The app is fully responsive, but you can customize how it looks on smaller screens by adjusting the media queries:
     ```css
     @media (max-width: 600px) {
         h1 {
             font-size: 28px;
         }
         #add-todo-btn {
             padding: 8px 12px;
         }
     }
     ```

## Fun Customization Ideas 🎨

### 🌟 **Add Emojis to Tasks**
   - Emojis are a fun way to make your tasks stand out! You can add emojis directly in the task description or in the buttons.
   - For example:
     ```html
     <button id="add-todo-btn">➕ Add New Task</button>
     ```

### 🎶 **Animate Buttons and Tasks**
   - Add animations when hovering over buttons or tasks to make the app more interactive. You can use CSS keyframes for this.
   - Example animation:
     ```css
     #todo-list li:hover {
         transform: scale(1.05);  /* Enlarge the task on hover */
         transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
     }
     ```

## Troubleshooting 🔧

If you encounter any issues, here are a few common problems and how to fix them:

### 🛑 **Tasks Not Saving**
   - Make sure you're handling task data correctly in JavaScript (if applicable).
   - Check that your browser allows local storage if the app uses it.

### 🛑 **Layout Issues on Mobile**
   - Ensure the media queries are set correctly in your CSS to adapt the layout for smaller screens.
